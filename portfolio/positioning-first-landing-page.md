title: "Positioning-First Landing Page for a Course Creator"
type: "Concept Project"
service: ["Landing Page", "Positioning & Copy"]
audience: "Digital marketing course creators"
---

## Overview
This project demonstrates a positioning-focused landing page created for a course creator with a strong product but unclear messaging.

The goal was not to say more, but to say the right things—clearly, selectively, and without distraction.

---

## The Problem
The original challenge was not traffic or credibility, but focus.

Common issues included:
- An offer that tried to appeal to everyone
- Multiple promises competing for attention
- Features explained before the value was clear

As a result, visitors had to work too hard to understand whether the course was for them.

---

## The Approach
I approached this project by prioritizing positioning before persuasion.

The page was designed to:
- Clearly define who the course is for and who it is not
- Emphasize the core outcome instead of listing features
- Remove sections that did not support the main decision
- Maintain a calm, confident tone throughout

Every element on the page had to justify its presence.

---

## The Solution
The final landing page focuses on:
- A single, specific headline describing the course’s purpose
- Clear audience qualification early in the page
- Minimal section count with strong hierarchy
- Copy that explains the offer without exaggeration

The result is a page that feels deliberate rather than promotional.

---

## Outcome
This example shows how clear positioning and restraint can improve how a course offer is perceived, making it easier for the right audience to self-select.

---

## Notes
This is a concept project created to demonstrate my approach to positioning and message clarity for digital course landing pages.
