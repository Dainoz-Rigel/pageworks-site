title: "Course Sales Landing Page for a Digital Marketing Educator"
type: "Concept Project"
service: ["Landing Page", "Conversion Copy"]
audience: "Nigerian digital marketing course creators"
---

## Overview
This project demonstrates a course sales landing page designed for a digital marketing educator selling a paid course to cold and warm traffic.

The goal was to clarify the offer, reduce buyer hesitation, and guide visitors toward enrollment without relying on hype-driven claims.

---

## The Problem
Many course landing pages fail because:
- The offer is obvious to the creator but unclear to first-time visitors
- Benefits are listed without structure or prioritization
- The page tries to convince instead of explain

This results in hesitation, confusion, and low conversion despite traffic.

---

## The Approach
I treated copy and layout as one system.

The page was structured to:
- Clearly state who the course is for (and who it is not)
- Explain the transformation in practical terms
- Address common objections early
- Present proof and credibility without exaggeration
- Use a single, focused call-to-action

---

## The Solution
The final page includes:
- A direct headline describing the course outcome
- A simplified offer breakdown
- Clear section flow from problem → solution → proof → action
- Calm, precise copy designed to reduce friction rather than create urgency

The design prioritizes readability, hierarchy, and clarity over visual noise.

---

## Outcome
This example shows how clear positioning and structured messaging can make a course offer easier to understand and easier to act on.

---

## Notes
This is a concept project created to demonstrate my approach to landing page structure and conversion-focused copy for digital course creators.
