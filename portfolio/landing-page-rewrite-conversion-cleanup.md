title: "Landing Page Rewrite to Improve Clarity and Conversion Flow"
type: "Redesign Concept"
service: ["Landing Page", "Copy Refinement"]
audience: "Digital marketing course creators"
---

## Overview
This project demonstrates a landing page rewrite for an existing digital marketing course whose original page struggled with clarity and focus.

The objective was not to add more persuasion, but to simplify the message, reduce friction, and improve how the offer was understood.

---

## The Problem
The original page showed common issues:
- Multiple claims competing for attention
- Benefits listed without hierarchy or context
- Calls-to-action placed without a clear narrative flow

While the course itself was valuable, the page required too much effort from the reader to understand what was being offered and why it mattered.

---

## The Approach
I approached this as a cleanup rather than a reinvention.

The focus was to:
- Identify what information was essential and remove the rest
- Reorder sections to follow a clearer decision path
- Rewrite copy to be more specific and less promotional
- Align calls-to-action with moments of clarity instead of urgency

Every change was made to reduce cognitive load.

---

## The Solution
The rewritten page features:
- A more direct headline explaining the course outcome
- Fewer, clearer benefit statements
- Improved section transitions
- A single primary call-to-action supported by context

The design and copy work together to guide the reader instead of pushing them forward.

---

## Outcome
The revised structure demonstrates how removing excess copy and improving hierarchy can make a course offer easier to understand and easier to act on.

---

## Notes
This redesign concept is based on a public course landing page and was created to demonstrate my approach to diagnosing and improving underperforming landing pages.
