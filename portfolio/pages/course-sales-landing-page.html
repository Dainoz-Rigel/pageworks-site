<!-- The Problem -->
<section class="py-5 bg-light">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h2>The Challenge Many Professionals Face</h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
          You know your field, you have experience, and you can help others—but turning that into a structured course is harder than it looks. 
          Many people start with enthusiasm but get stuck in these common situations:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3">
          <li>Too many ideas, unsure which to prioritise</li>
          <li>Content overload without a clear path</li>
          <li>Difficulty explaining the value without sounding salesy</li>
          <li>Fear of launching something incomplete or unclear</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The result is often frustration, unfinished courses, or giving up entirely. This course was created to remove that uncertainty—step by step, calmly and clearly.

        <h2>Why I Built This Course</h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
          My name is <strong>Chinelo Eze</strong>, and for years I helped professionals create workshops, content, and training programs. I noticed a recurring pattern: 
          talented people would abandon their course ideas not because they lacked knowledge, but because the process was unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed <strong>From Idea to Income</strong> to provide a simple, calm framework that anyone with expertise can follow. No hype, no tricks—just a practical path to sharing your knowledge.
